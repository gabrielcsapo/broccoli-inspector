    <h3>Hiding the <code>\{{paper-input}}</code> character counts</h3>
    <p>
      Material Design <a href="https://material.google.com/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-character-counter">requires that a character count is displayed</a> for input elements which have a length restriction. However, when forms have many input elements, some may prefer to display the count only when the element is focused or invalid. This CSS achieves this.
